Hello I've spent 3 hours now trying to research on how to make github ignore my data file on Vs code when I push and when that didn't work 
I tried to install a LFS system where Github would take larger files. Both have failed and I reached out on Discord but I have not heard 
back yet. For now, I do not want to miss the deadline for this assignment so I have attached my datafiles in a Google drive and linked it 
on the README document as instructed.
